# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-google-play-app-store

In this project, i assume that i am working as a **data analysts** for the company that builds **android & iOS mobile apps** which are then made available on Google Play and the App Store.

They only build apps that are free to download & install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the no. of users who use that app.

Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users .
